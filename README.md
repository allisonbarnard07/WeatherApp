# WeatherApp
<br>
Using HTML, CSS, JS, AJAX, and JQuery I built a weather app that will display the following information when someone puts a city into the Search Bar and presses enter: 
<br>
Icons, Weather in Â°F, Wind, Humidity
<br>
The user's previous searches will be saved. They can add as many searches on as they would like and the app will store the previous weather searches.
